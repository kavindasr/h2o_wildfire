## About h2o.ai wildfire-challange

Wildfires (aka bushfires) threaten lives, communities, wildlife, and forests every year, and with global climate change, it is getting worse.This problem is regional within countries, but it is a global issue and is considered one of the most dangerous disasters we face. While humans cause many fires, other factors, including wind, lightning, drought, and landscape, impact where fires occur and how they spread.

## Our mission
Our goal is to predict wildfires in Australia based on the location.  

## How we predict wildfires

## About dataset
FIRMS distributes Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data within 3 hours of satellite observation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ([VIIRS](https://www.jpss.noaa.gov/viirs.html)) aboard S-NPP and NOAA 20.
