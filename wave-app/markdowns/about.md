## About h2o.ai wildfire-challange

Wildfires (aka bushfires) threaten lives, communities, wildlife, and forests every year, and with global climate change, it is getting worse.This problem is regional within countries, but it is a global issue and is considered one of the most dangerous disasters we face. While humans cause many fires, other factors, including wind, lightning, drought, and landscape, impact where fires occur and how they spread.

## Our mission
