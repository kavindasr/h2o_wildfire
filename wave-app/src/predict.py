### 2019â€“20 Australian bushfire season
From September 2019 until March 2020, when the final fire was extinguished, Australia had one of the worst bush fire seasons in its recorded history.
As it can be seen from the satellite dataset New South Wales and Victoria have been worst affected.
More than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,400 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.
